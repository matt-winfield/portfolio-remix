# Matt Winfield - Portfolio

This is my portfolio website, built using Remix.

## Getting Started

Make sure you are using node 18 and pnpm 8. You can check with `node -v` and
`pnpm -v`.

Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies. Then run `pnpm run setup` to
configure the project for local development.

Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.

Run `pnpm test` to run unit tests, and `pnpm test:e2e` to run end-to-end tests.

Run `pnpm prisma:studio` to open the Prisma Studio GUI.

Run `pnpm format` to format the code.
